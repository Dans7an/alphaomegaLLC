# alphaomegaLLC
alphaomegaLLC is a website I built for a drywall company based in New Jersey that installs and finishes drywall in housing properties.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I used Paint.Net to sketch both the header and footer images

Optimizations
I initially had issues with configuring the footer image and text on safari so I had to twick with a few CSS property inorder to maintain a similar look across different devices

Lessons Learned:
Never assume something you have built will always work on all devices, it must be proven and tried by fire.
