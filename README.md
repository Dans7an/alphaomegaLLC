<h3>How It's Made:</h3>
Tech used: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I used Paint.Net to sketch both the header and footer images

<h3>Optimizations</h3>
I initially had issues with configuring the footer image and text on safari so I had to twick with a few CSS property inorder to maintain a similar look across different devices

<h3>Lessons Learned:</h3>
I should Never assume something you have built will always work on all browers, it must be proven and tried by fire.
